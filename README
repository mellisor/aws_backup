To set up:

1. Run setup.sh
2. If new keys are needed, run genkeys.py. Otherwise, place necessary keys in the 'keys' directory.
   Only the public key is needed for encryption

To upload:

1. Specify directories to upload as well as file prefixes to exclude in backup.conf
2. Run upload.py as superuser. Make sure python3 is used

To decrypt:

1. Run decrypt.py /path/to/file (OPTIONAL: use -p to specify passphrase or -k to specify key path. 
   Otherwise, defaults in backup.conf are used)
